# Weather_App-React

A simple Weather App made using React and OpenweaterAPI.

## TO USE

1. Download all of the files and make sure you also hae nodeJS intalled
2. run: ***npx expo install expo-constants***
3. run: ***npm i @expo/vector-icons***
4. make an account for open weather api, get you api key and put it in the *API-KEY* in /src/index.js
5. run: ***npx expo start***

And that should be it. To scan the Qr code it gives, make sure you have the expo app

## Future versions that I am working on

Version 1.5(ig): 
  - fix up styling and incorporate different fonts

Version 2: 
  - Add in dynamic backgrounds that change depending on the weather and time.
  - Use Open Weather API to put in weather icons
  - add a new page with forcasts and the ability to save common cities
